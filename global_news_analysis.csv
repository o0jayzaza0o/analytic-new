Thousands without power in freezing Ukraine as renewed Russian strikes continue,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crley6x0dgzo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss,"Wed, 04 Feb 2026 14:55:09 GMT",Ukraine's leader says regions including Kyiv and Kharkiv are among those suffering the most from blackouts as a result of recent attacks.,"Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky says more than 200 repair crews are working to restore power in Kyiv following widespread deadly Russian attacks targeting the country's energy sector.  More than 1,100 apartment buildings in the capital are still without power, Zelensky said, adding that he had spoken to officials about supporting communities in other affected parts of Ukraine. In the eastern Ukrainian town of Druzhkivka, seven people were killed and fifteen injured in Russian cluster bomb strikes, the regional head said. Moscow has recently renewed its attacks after a week-long pause that US President Donald Trump had asked Vladimir Putin to observe as a fierce cold swept Ukraine. Meanwhile, US, Ukrainian and Russian officials are again meeting in Abu Dhabi to discuss details of a peace plan. However, there a few signs a breakthrough is imminent during the second round of such trilateral talks in the United Arab Emirates. Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.  ""As of today, the toughest situation is in Kyiv and the region, Kharkiv and the region, Sumy region, and Poltava region,"" Zelensky wrote on social media on Wednesday. ""It is also difficult in other parts of central Ukraine, including Dnipro and Cherkasy regions."" He added that more repair teams would be brought in to help restore power ""to ensure proper rotation of crew members - people are exhausted."" Residents have been forced to spend the night sheltering in Kyiv's metro stations, with some pitching tents on the platforms to protect them from the freezing cold. Authorities have set up centres around the city for people to go to warm up. They are also importing more generators to cope with longer blackout periods as engineers try to fix the damage. In the north-eastern city of Kharkiv, a power plant has been damaged beyond repair. Ukraine's Energy Minister, Denys Shmyhal, said the country's energy system would take some time to fix. This includes Kyiv's Darnytsia Combined Heat and Power (CHP) plant, which Shmyhal said had been ""severely damaged"".  Iryna Vovk is a psychologist who lives in Kyiv with her daughter. Her husband is away fighting. Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Vovk said she was considering moving to her parents' village because of the problems accessing electricity and water in the capital. ""Here in Kyiv, life is very awful,"" she said. Asked how her daughter is coping, Vovk said she was ""okay in general"". ""She tries to smile and lead a normal life but it's not a normal life. She cannot study [like] normal, she cannot use online lessons."" UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said Russia's attacks on Ukraine's energy sector on Monday night - as temperatures dropped to -20C (-4F) - were ""barbaric"" and ""particularly depraved"". He made the comments following a phone call with Trump hours after Russia hit power plants and critical infrastructure in Kyiv and elsewhere. Trump told reporters that Putin had ""kept his word"" on the week-long pause.  The agreement ""was on Sunday, and he [Putin] went from Sunday to Sunday"", Trump said when asked whether he was disappointed with Russia's renewed attacks. ""It's a lot, you know, one week, we'll take anything, because it's really, really cold over there.""  The US president has been leading efforts to end the war, but his Russian counterpart has refused calls for a ceasefire. The Ukrainian Air Force said it was attacked by more than 100 drones early on Wednesday. While it had intercepted most of these, it added, drone strikes were reported in 14 locations, along with falling debris. Seven casualties were reported in Druzhkivka by Vadym Filashkin, the head of the eastern Donetsk region. He wrote on Telegram that Russians had hit the city with cluster shells, including a busy market. The head of Dnipropetrovsk's military administration, Oleksandr Ganzha, said a 68-year-old woman and a 38-year-old man were killed in a Russian attack. In the Zaporizhzhia region, leader Ivan Federov said three people were killed and 11 wounded, including children, during attacks on Tuesday evening that continued overnight.  The Russian-controlled government in the neighbouring Luhansk region said a man and a woman were killed on Tuesday night in a drone attack, launched by Ukraine, which hit a minibus.  In Russia itself, the governor of the western Bryansk region, Alexandra Bogomaz, said Ukraine had launched a ""combined attack"" including drones and long-range missiles - destroying a residential building and injuring one person. Further south in Belgorod, close to the border with Ukraine, governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said work was continuing to restore power and water services following a Ukrainian missile strike there earlier in the week.  Meanwhile, peace talks continue, with top US envoys again meeting negotiators from Russia and Ukraine in the UAE on Wednesday and Thursday.  Special envoy Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, Trump's son-in-law, are joining teams of Russian and Ukrainian negotiators in the capital, Abu Dhabi, to try and thrash out a US-proposed peace deal. The most difficult issue is territory, with Russia demanding that Ukraine cedes the rest of the eastern industrial region of Donbas that Moscow does not currently control.  The first talks between the three parties, which were also held in Abu Dhabi, ended earlier this month with no apparent result. The New Start treaty has limited the number of deployed strategic nuclear warheads for both countries. An MoD Police probe into sightings at USAF bases in Norfolk, Suffolk and Gloucestershire concludes. British troops will get extra powers to shoot down drones near military bases, the UK government says. Fifteen others were reported injured in the strike near a bus carrying the workers on Sunday.

Melinda French Gates says ex-husband Bill has questions to answer over Epstein,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cr4kyk9nv5lo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss,"Wed, 04 Feb 2026 12:20:19 GMT",She said her ex-husband and others named in the Epstein files needed to answer whatever questions remain.,"Billionaire philanthropist Melinda French Gates has said her ex-husband, Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, being named in new files relating to the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein dredged up ""painful times in my marriage"". She told an NPR podcast she felt ""unbelievable sadness"", and that ""whatever questions remain"" needed to be answered by those named in the records, including her ex-husband. ""I am so happy to be away from all the muck,"" she said. The couple divorced in 2021. Records released by the US justice department include an allegation by Epstein that Bill Gates caught a sexually transmitted disease. Gates's spokesperson has called the claim ""absolutely absurd"". The BBC has contacted his representatives for comments about his ex-wife's remarks.  Bill Gates has not been accused of wrongdoing by any of Epstein's victims, and the appearance of his name in the files does not imply criminal activity of any kind.  The billionaire has broken his silence on the release of files by the US Department of Justice (DOJ) in an interview with 9News in Australia. He said the interactions with Epstein were limited to dinners and that he did not visit Epstein's island.  ""Every minute I spent with him I regret and I apologise that I did that,"" Gates added.  In the interview with NPR's Wild Card podcast, Melinda French Gates said: ""For me, it's personally hard whenever those details come up, right? Because it brings back memories of some very, very painful times in my marriage."" She added: ""Whatever questions remain there of what - I can't even begin to know all of it - those questions are for those people and for even my ex-husband. They need to answer to those things, not me."" US media have reported that before their separation - which followed 27 years of marriage - Melinda French Gates had been upset about her husband's association with Epstein. After their split was announced, Bill Gates acknowledged having had an affair with a Microsoft employee in 2019.  The allegations about Bill Gates were included in more than three million documents released last week by the DOJ.  Two emails from 18 July 2013 appear to have been drafted by Epstein, but it is unclear if they were ever sent to Gates.  Both were sent from Epstein's email account and back to the same account, while no email account associated with Gates is visible and both emails are unsigned. One email is written as a resignation letter from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and complains about having had to procure medicine for Bill ""to deal with the consequences of sex with Russian girls"". The other, which begins ""dear Bill"", complains about Bill Gates having ended a friendship and makes more claims about Bill Gates having tried to cover up a sexually transmitted infection, including from his then-wife, Melinda. In his interview with Australian media, Bill Gates added that the email was never sent and the contents of it were ""false"".  Over the years, Bill Gates and his representatives have downplayed his connection with Epstein. He has previously said they only had ""several dinners"" to discuss a philanthropy project that did not happen.  After the latest allegations, a spokesperson for Bill Gates said: ""The only thing these documents demonstrate is Epstein's frustration that he did not have an ongoing relationship with Gates and the lengths he would go to entrap and defame."" They added: ""These claims – from a proven, disgruntled liar – are absolutely absurd and completely false."" Many of the documents, emails and photos included in the millions of files released by the DOJ last week shed light on Epstein's vast network of celebrities, business chiefs and world leaders - contacts that persisted in some cases even after his 2008 conviction for soliciting sex from a 14-year-old girl.  Epstein died in a New York jail in 2019 while awaiting trial in a sex-trafficking case.  The New Start treaty has limited the number of deployed strategic nuclear warheads for both countries. Prosecutors claimed that Routh, 59, remained ""totally unrepentant"" for the incident in Florida.  Shops and homes were torched in an attack on two villages in the western state of Kwara, a lawmaker says. The 84 year-old mother of Savannah Guthrie, the popular co-host of the NBC news show Today, was last seen at her Arizona home on Saturday night.

"Andrew and Epstein asked exotic dancer for 'sex acts,' legal letter claims",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckgkjj5e28ko?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss,"Wed, 04 Feb 2026 18:02:50 GMT",Lawyers for the unnamed woman claim she was 'treated like a prostitute' at Jeffrey Epstein's home.,"Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor and Jeffrey Epstein asked an exotic dancer to ""engage in various sex acts"" at the late convicted sex offender's Florida home, a legal letter claims. In a letter released as part of the latest tranche of Epstein files, the unnamed woman's lawyers said she had been offered $10,000 to dance and that after she performed Epstein and Mountbatten-Windsor had asked for a threesome. Lawyers said the woman had not been paid the promised amount and would keep the alleged 2006 encounter in which she was ""treated like a prostitute"" confidential in exchange for a payment of $250,000. BBC News has contacted Mountbatten-Windsor for comment. He has always denied any wrongdoing.  The letter, dated March 2011, claims that the woman and other exotic dancers from ""Rachel's Strip Club"" in West Palm Beach had been chauffeured to Epstein's house and offered $10,000 to perform. The document claims that she had seen ""other young women dressed provocatively"" at the party, some of whom ""appeared to be as young as 14 years old"". After she arrived, she was directed upstairs where she was introduced by Epstein to Mountbatten-Windsor, the letter says. It alleges: ""My client then danced for the men, undressing until she was wearing only a bra and panties. Mr. Epstein and Prince Andrew then told my client they wanted to have a threesome. ""She said she was hired to dance, not to have sex. Mr Epstein said they would pay her later for dancing, and they prevailed upon her to engage in various sex acts."" The letter claims that ""after the men had satisfied themselves"" she was invited to take a trip with the pair to the Virgin Islands, which she declined. Lawyers said she had only been paid $2,000 of the promised fee of $10,000. The woman had not previously pursued the claims because she was ""not proud of the circumstances of that night,"" the letter says. ""She was working as an exotic dancer, but she was treated like a prostitute."" It is unclear whether the claim was ever settled. Epstein also set up a London dinner between Mountbatten-Windsor and a 26-year-old Russian woman in August 2010, emails show. The woman later thanked Epstein describing it as an ""amazing night"" and describing her trip to London as ""a special adventure"". In the emails Epstein contacts the former prince on 11 August saying he has a friend ""I think you might enjoy having dinner with"". He describes the woman as ""26, russian, clevere [sic] beautiful, trustworthy"" after Andrew says he would be ""delighted to see her"" and inquires if there is any information about her that might be ""useful to know"". The correspondence and suggested meeting came two years after Epstein was convicted for soliciting prostitution for a minor and registered as a sex offender. The Russian woman contacted Epstein on 8 August 2010 asking for his advice: ""If I go to London (on my way back from Russia) sometime between August 27 and Sept 5 do you think somebody will be there and what are the best dates?"" After Epstein replies suggesting dates that are ""best"", the woman confirms she has booked tickets and will be in London between the 20 and 25 August. Later that day is when Epstein wrote to Mountbatten-Windsor to suggest the dinner with his ""friend"": ""her name is [redacted] she will be london [sic] 20-24"". The former prince replied: ""Of course. I am in Geneva until the morning of 22nd but would be delighted to see her. Will she be bringing a message from you? Please give her my contact details to get in touch."" Adding in a further email: ""Great. Any other information you might know about her that might be useful to know? Like what have you told her about me and have you given her my email as well?"" The next day Epstein wrote to the Russian woman saying, ""the evening of the 22 nd confimed [sic]"". She replies: ""Great!!!!!!! Should I email him [Andrew's email address] I can't wait! Thank you"". While the emails do not confirm if the dinner definitely went ahead, in correspondence the Russian woman responds to an email from Epstein on 22 August asking ""but [sic] are you having fun"" saying ""I had an amazing night, thank you!"" On 25 August she sends a further email to Epstein saying she was going to Russia and thanking him for everything. ""My trip has been a really special adventure."" The correspondence seen by the BBC suggests Epstein arranged for the Russian woman to meet male associates of his internationally on more than one occasion. Emails from August 2010 indicate that the woman flew to London via the Bahamas, where Epstein made arrangements for her to visit ""Eduardo"". The BBC understands this to be Eduardo Teodorani, an Italian businessman and chairman and vice president at the Italian Chamber of Commerce and Industry for the UK. The BBC has contacted Teodorani for comment. Mountbatten-Windsor is under mounting pressure to give evidence about his relationship with the late convicted sex offender. Photographs appearing to show the former prince kneeling on all fours over a female lying on the ground were included in the latest batch of Epstein files released by the US Department of Justice on Friday. Both are fully clothed.  He has faced allegations, which he has repeatedly denied, that he sexually assaulted Virginia Giuffre as a teenager after she said she was trafficked by Epstein. Mountbatten-Windsor paid a financial settlement to Giuffre to settle a civil sexual assault claim in 2022. A key Labour figure for decades, Lord Mandelson faces renewed scrutiny over his relationship with Jeffrey Epstein. Twenty new photos released on Friday show Epstein in the immediate aftermath of his death. The couple will appear on two separate days in late February for a deposition after coming to an agreement with the House oversight committee.  She said her ex-husband and others named in the Epstein files needed to answer whatever questions remain. The US Department of Justice faces criticism from victims after names and unredacted images included in latest release. Copyright 2026 BBC. All rights reserved.

"Israeli strikes kill 20 in Gaza, hospitals say, after soldier wounded by gunfire",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cpqyg0g5r0po?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss,"Wed, 04 Feb 2026 13:27:07 GMT",Hospitals say several children were among those killed in strikes that Israel's military says it launched after a gun attack on its troops.,"At least 20 Palestinians, including several children and a paramedic, have been killed and almost 40 others wounded in Israeli strikes in Gaza, hospitals say. The Israeli military said tanks and aircraft carried out ""precise strikes"" against what it called ""terrorists"" who opened fire on troops in the north of the strip, seriously wounding an officer. It added that the attack happened close to the Yellow Line, beyond which Israeli forces are stationed in Gaza, and that it constituted a ""blatant violation"" of the three-month-old ceasefire deal with Hamas. Hamas accused Israel of using the shooting as ""a flimsy pretext to justify the continuation of killing and aggression against our people"". Al-Shifa hospital in Gaza City said it had received the bodies of 13 people, including five children, who were killed when tents for displaced families and homes in the eastern Zeitoun and Tuffah neighbourhoods were hit. Among the mourners gathered in the hospital's courtyard for funeral prayers was Abu Mohammed Haboush, who said his family was asleep in their home when it was shelled. ""Our children were martyred - my son was martyred, my brother's son and daughter were martyred,"" he told Reuters news agency. ""We have nothing to do with anything, we are peaceful people."" Nasser hospital in the city of Khan Younis said four dead, including one child, were brought there following strikes on tents in the southern Qizan Rashwan area. Another two children, sisters Rahaf and Remas Abu Jamea, and paramedic Hussein al-Samiri were later killed in the coastal al-Mawasi area west of Khan Younis, hospital officials said. A first responder from the Hamas-run Civil Defence agency, Jihad al-Hinnawi, told Reuters that the paramedic had rushed to help victims of a strike on a tent in the coastal al-Mawasi area and was then killed by a second strike on the same location. The Palestinian Red Crescent said separately that Samiri was killed ""while carrying out his humanitarian duty in Khan Younis"". It also accused the Israeli military of a ""grave violation"" of international humanitarian law, which protects medical personnel. The International Committee of the Red Cross said it was ""appalled"" to learn of Samiri's killing and stressed that it was ""unacceptable that first responders in Gaza continue to face risk to their lives while carrying out humanitarian mission"". The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said the strike in al-Mawasi targeted a platoon commander of the elite Nukhba forces of Hamas's military wing, whom it named as Bilal Abu Assi. It alleged that he had led the attack on Kibbutz Nir Oz on 7 October 2023 and ""likely took part in holding deceased hostages captive throughout the war"". ""The IDF is aware of the claim that several uninvolved civilians, including a medical staff member, were hit in the strike. Prior to and during the strike, steps were taken in order to mitigate harm to civilians,"" it added. Both Israel and Hamas have accused each other of near-daily violations since the ceasefire took effect on 10 October. On Sunday, more than 30 people were killed in Israeli strikes across Gaza. The IDF said its forces launched those strikes after gunmen emerged from a tunnel in the southern Rafah area, beyond the Yellow Line. Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry has said at least 556 people have been killed by Israeli fire, while the Israeli military has said four of its soldiers have been killed in Palestinian attacks. The war was triggered by the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage. Israel responded to the attack by launching a military campaign in Gaza, during which more than 71,820 people have been killed, according to the territory's health ministry. Medical charity Medicine Sans Frontières said it would not share the list as it had not been able to ensure staff would remain safe. Israel's military confirmed the strikes, which come during a ceasefire that Israel and Hamas accuse each other of breaking. Analysts believe PM Netanyahu is urging the US towards maximalist strikes. In a highly controversial move, some Israeli MPs are trying to introduce the death penalty for Palestinian attackers. South Africa accuses the Israeli envoy of insulting President Ramaphosa.

Son of Norway's crown princess holds back tears giving evidence at rape trial,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c23rdxjjp4po?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss,"Wed, 04 Feb 2026 16:00:39 GMT",Marius Borg Høiby gives evidence after the first woman he is alleged to have raped told the court she believed she had been drugged.,"The son of Norway's crown princess has told a court in Oslo he has lived a life of partying out of an extreme need of validation, on the second day of his trial for rape and more than 30 other alleged offences. Marius Borg Høiby, 29, looked overwhelmed by the occasion, his voice quivering as he paused several times to take off his glasses and wipe his eyes.  Holding back tears, he said it was very difficult to talk, and complained of being followed by the press since he was three years old. He denies four allegations of rape as well as other serious charges against him.  He was giving evidence after the first woman he is alleged to have raped told the court she believed ""100 percent"" that she had been drugged during an ""after-party"" in the basement of Høiby's parents' house in December 2018. The woman spoke of her sense of ""betrayal and shock"" after police showed her videos several years later, allegedly depicting him sexually assaulting her shortly after they had had brief, consensual sex. She had already spoken of a ""black hole"" in her memory and told the court behind closed doors that she had no recollection of what happened. The court has ordered the media not to give any information that might identify any of the four women. There is also a ban on any photos of Marius Borg Høiby, either inside the court building or on his way to and from the trial.  The 29-year-old defendant, who was born four years before his mother, Mette-Marit, married Norway's Crown Prince Haakon, is not a member of the royal family or a public figure, but grew up as part of the wider family. During his first appearance in court on Tuesday, he was seen shaking. He is understood have had hospital treatment overnight.  Høiby was arrested on Sunday on suspicion of assault and wielding a knife and remanded in custody for four weeks. However, he did not return to custody before his statement on Wednesday. He took a seat in court and after several minutes appearing to be overcome by the occasion, he regained his composure and told the court he had had a lot of sex, drugs and alcohol because he had an extreme need of validation. ""I am known for being Mamma's son. Nothing else,"" he told the three judges. ""Few can relate to the life I have led. A lot of parties, alcohol, some drugs."" His trial comes at a tense moment for his mother, who was found to have exchanged hundreds of messages with the late US sex offender Jeffrey Epstein over a three-year period. The royal palace said on Wednesday that Crown Princess Mette-Marit had postponed a private trip ""until further notice"", without giving further details. She has expressed regret and poor judgement over the correspondence. However, the storm of criticism over the unguarded, warm tone of the exchanges has heaped pressure on the royal house, when Mette-Marit is also seeing her son on trial for rape.  Marius Borg Høiby was arrested in August 2024 after a violent incident at his girlfriend's flat in the Frogner area of western Oslo, when he is alleged to have torn down a chandelier, thrown a knife at the wall and shattered a mirror, while hurling abuse at her. At the time he spoke of having suffered for years with mental issues and admitted to substance abuse.  After a lengthy police investigation, he was charged a large number of offences, ranging from rape, assault, threatening a girlfriend and damaging her flat, as well as drugs charges and driving offences. If found guilty he could face at least 10 years in jail. He is accused of raping four women between December 2018 and November 2024, all of them after consensual sex, and while they were either asleep or incapacitated. One of the charges involves full intercourse, and the other three sexual assault, which is also seen as rape in Norway. Wearing a dark blue woollen sweater over of a smart beige shirt, he looked straight at the three judges who were sitting about 10m (30ft) away from him. Later in the afternoon he removed the sweater. Although he had notes, he rarely looked down at them. He spoke for about half an hour without interruption. Høiby did not look to his left where two of the women he is alleged to have raped listened to his evidence a short distance away.  The woman who gave evidence earlier did not stay in court. He spoke of how he met her at a party in 2018 and had taken cocaine for the first time. When he finished giving his statement, prosecutor Sturla Henriksbø asked him about the first alleged rape in 2018. The defendant disputed the account given earlier, and said he did not remember taking videos, denying they had had brief consensual sex for a few seconds in a toilet in his parents' basement. Instead he said they had had consensual sex after others at the after-party had gone to bed. Asked by the prosecutor if she had been awake when they had sex, he was adamant: ""I don't sleep with women who aren't awake."" The 29-year-old has denied all but one of six counts of sexually offensive conduct without consent which includes filming graphic videos. In his testimony, he admitted filming a five-minute video of the woman in his family's basement, although he did not remember doing so. When pressed by the prosecutor how he could be sure she was awake in the video, he appeared to become frustrated, saying he had said ""a million times"" he did not remember the sequence of events. The woman's attorney, Heidi Reisvang, told the BBC that it had been extremely hard for her client to give evidence over two days and she was relieved it was over: ""The most important thing for her was to say she was not able to resist or give consent."" Marius Borg Høiby also took aim at the Norwegian press, accusing them of twisting the facts, disputing a story that his mother had taken a sim-card out of his phone before it was handed to police at the time of his arrest in August 2024. He is due to continue giving evidence on Thursday. Marius Borg Høiby is accused of 38 charges including four counts of rape in one of the biggest cases in Norway for years. Norway's royal family has been embroiled in recent scandals, including Crown Princess Mette-Marit links with Epstein. Marius Borg Høiby, who goes on trial on Tuesday, has been remanded in custody for four weeks after new allegations. Jonas Gahr Støre says he agreed with Princess Mette-Marit's own remarks over her contacts with the late sex offender. Marius Borg Høiby, the crown prince's blond stepson, is accused of 38 charges in a case that has attracted global interest. Copyright 2026 BBC. All rights reserved.

German activist jailed in Hungary for attacks at Nazi rally,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clyn7wkgkp0o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss,"Wed, 04 Feb 2026 17:34:54 GMT","Supporters have questioned whether the 25-year-old, who identifies as non-binary, could receive a fair trial in Hungary.","A German activist has been sentenced to eight years in a Hungarian prison for assaulting right-wing extremists and for being a member of an extreme left-wing group. The 25-year-old, identified only as Maja T., was found guilty of involvement in violent assaults by the group Antifa Ost in the lead-up to an annual commemoration of Nazi soldiers in Budapest. But supporters have raised concerns over whether Maja T., who identifies as non-binary, could receive a fair trial in the Hungarian court, because the country legally recognises only two genders and Pride marches are banned.  Last year, Germany's Constitutional Court found Maja T. could face discriminatory treatment and said an extradition should not proceed.  But the ruling came too late to stop the handover, as police in Germany had already delivered Maja T. to Hungarian authorities by helicopter in an overnight operation in 2024. The 25-year-old did not comment on the allegations during the trial and the verdict is subject to appeal. In February 2023, far-right groups from across Europe gathered in Budapest to commemorate the anniversary of the end of the Second World War. The so-called Day of Honour marked an attempt in 1945 by the German Wehrmacht, the Waffen-SS, and their Hungarian collaborators to break through a Soviet siege of the city. The commemoration is tolerated by the Hungarian authorities. Between 9 and 11 February 2023, about 20 alleged left-wing extremists from Antifa Ost, a militant far-left multinational group also known as the ""hammer gang"", attacked people with batons, rubber hammers and pepper spray at several places in Budapest.  Officials said the attackers believed their victims had participated in the commemoration. Nine people were injured in a number of incidents, four of them seriously.  Prosecutors said Maja T. was involved in two attacks and part of a criminal organisation. German MEP Martin Schirdewan from the socialist Die Linke party described the proceedings as a ""political show trial"", and said Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán had ""deliberately exploited this trial for his election campaign"". ""Eight years in prison for Maja T. is disproportionate,"" he wrote. ""This is not about justice, but about setting a political example."" Trials of other members of Antifa Ost are currently under way in German courts in Düsseldorf and Dresden.  Those trials are focused on the violence in Budapest and other incidents in Germany. Hungary classifies Antifa Ost as a terrorist group, along with the US, which made the designation last November as part of the Trump administration's crackdown on Antifa activists.  The designation makes group members ineligible to enter the US, freezes any assets they may have there and makes it a crime to provide material support to the group. Germany's far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party has called for Antifa Ost to be banned domestically.  Granting asylum to a citizen of a fellow EU member goes against the spirit of EU standards. Russia's leader praised what he called Orban's ""balanced position on the situation in Ukraine"".

Fears of new arms race as US-Russia nuclear weapons treaty due to expire,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4g31n4ey9go?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss,"Wed, 04 Feb 2026 18:39:22 GMT",The New Start treaty has limited the number of deployed strategic nuclear warheads for both countries.,"The last nuclear weapons control treaty between the US and Russia is due to expire on Thursday, raising fears of a new arms race.   The Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, known as ""New START"" and signed in 2010 was one of a handful of agreements designed to help prevent a catastrophic nuclear war. The treaty capped the number of deployed strategic nuclear warheads for each party to 1,550. It also established some transparency including data transfer, notifications and on site inspections. The treaty's expiry effectively marks an end to the arms control co-operation between Washington and Moscow that helped bring an end to the Cold War.  On Wednesday, Pope Leo urged the US and Russia to renew the treaty, saying the current world situation required ""calls for doing everything possible to avert a new arms race"". The original Start treaty - signed in 1991 by the US and the Soviet Union - barred each of the two signatories from deploying more than 6,000 nuclear warheads. It was succeeded by New Start signed in 2010 in Prague by the US and Russia,  the successor state to the dissolved Soviet Union. Although Russia suspended the treaty three years ago as tensions grew over the Ukraine war, both countries were still thought to be abiding by the treaty. The agreement prevented the uncontrolled build-up of nuclear weapons and provided the two countries with the largest nuclear arsenals with transparency measures to avoid misjudging each other's intentions. Its expiry follows a worrying pattern. Other long-standing arms control treaties have already fallen by the wayside. They include: Britain's former head of the armed forces,  Admiral Sir Tony Radakin has warned that the architecture and frameworks that helped keep the world safe ""now risks  unravelling"".  In a speech last year he described the collapse of these key arms control treaties as ""one of the most dangerous aspects of our current global security"", along with ""the increasing prominence of nuclear weapons"". Russia's Dmitry Medvedev, who as the then president signed the New Start treaty in 2010, said its expiration should ""alarm everyone"". This is a sobering comment from a politician whose recent rhetoric has included nuclear threats.  On Wednesday, a senior adviser to Russian President Vladimir Putin said he intended to ""act in a measured manner and responsibly"" if the treaty expired. Later in the day, the Russian foreign ministry said in a statement that ""in the current circumstances, we assume that the parties to the New START are no longer bound by any obligations or symmetrical declarations in the context of the Treaty, including its core provisions, and are in principle free to choose their next steps.  ""In doing so the Russian Federation intends to act responsibly and in a balanced manner,"" the statement said, adding that Moscow ""remains ready to take decisive military-technical measures to counter potential additional threats to the national security"". US President Donald Trump has sounded less concerned. Last month, he told the New York Times: ""If it expires, it expires… We'll just do a better agreement"".  Washington believes that any future arms control treaty should also include China, which has been building up its nuclear arsenal.  Meanwhile, Russia has long argued that any future arms control treaty should include France and the UK - Europe's nuclear powers. Darya Dolzikova, a senior Research Fellow with the UK-based RUSI's Proliferation and Nuclear Policy Programme, said the expiration of New Start was ""concerning, because there are drivers on both sides to expand their strategic capabilities"". Both the US and Russia are currently modernising their nuclear forces and increasing their strategic capabilities. A new arms race is already under way.  Dolzikova said that for Russia ""there appears to be some concerns about their ability to penetrate US air defences"". This has only increased with Trump's plans to build a ""Golden Dome"" to protect North America from long-range weapons. But Russia has also been developing new weapons designed to overcome air defences. They include Poseidon - a new intercontinental, nuclear armed and nuclear powered undersea autonomous torpedo, and also Burevestnik – a nuclear armed and powered cruise missile.  The US, Russia and China are all developing long-range hypersonic missiles which can manoeuvre at speeds of more than 4,000 mph (6,437kmh), and are much harder to shoot down. Dolzikova said those expanding military capabilities would ""only make it harder"" to reach a new arms control treaty.  This is along with what she called the ""growing salience of nuclear weapons"". More, not fewer, countries appear to want them as a deterrent.   Nor does the US or Russia appear to be in a rush to sign a new arms control treaty.  The subject was on the agenda when Russian President Vladimir Putin met Trump in Alaska last year - but nothing happened.  A new deal is still possible - but the expiry of the New Start signals a more volatile, dangerous era. Prosecutors claimed that Routh, 59, remained ""totally unrepentant"" for the incident in Florida.  Shops and homes were torched in an attack on two villages in the western state of Kwara, a lawmaker says. The 84 year-old mother of Savannah Guthrie, the popular co-host of the NBC news show Today, was last seen at her Arizona home on Saturday night. The US border tsar has long been a ferocious defender of Donald Trump's immigration policies.

"Boy, 14, stabbed art teacher because he had 'too much hatred', he tells police",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2k82d78jno?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss,"Wed, 04 Feb 2026 16:44:30 GMT","The teenager allegedly took a knife from his kitchen with the plan to attack the 60-year-old, the prosecutor says.","A 14-year-old who stabbed his art teacher told French police he attacked her because he had ""too much hatred"", a prosecutor has said. The 60-year-old woman's condition remains a ""serious concern"" after she was stabbed three to four times in her chest in front of 22 students in south-eastern France on Tuesday, a local official said. Toulon prosecutor Raphaël Balland said in a statement that the boy had premeditated the attack, having described to police taking the knife from his kitchen at home with the ""intention of stabbing his teacher"". La Guicharde school, in Sanary-sur-Mer, was evacuated after the attack on Tuesday, and lessons the next day were cancelled. Balland said there was no known religious or political motivation for the stabbing and that the student was allegedly upset that the teacher had reported several disciplinary incidents against him, which the boy said were ""unfair"".  The teenager told authorities he ""deeply regretted"" the attack, AFP news agency reported, and felt more hatred towards himself than the victim. A decision on whether to place him in pre-trial detention will be made when he appears in court. The victim, who has been at the school for 28 years, according to AFP, is in Sainte-Anne Military Hospital in Toulon. She is reported to have been stabilised after surgery but remains in a serious condition. It is the latest in a series of attacks by students in French schools in recent years. Last year, a 14-year-old was charged with the murder of a teaching assistant after allegedly stabbing her to death in June. In a separate case in April, a student killed a girl and wounded several others in a knife attack in the western city of Nantes. In 2020, teacher Samuel Paty was murdered by a Chechen refugee outside the school where he taught in a suburb of Paris, an attack which was motivated by religious extremism. Education minister Édouard Geffray, who visited the Toulon school on Tuesday, has described the attack as ""unacceptable"" and said that since March last year, 525 bladed weapons had been seized at schools ""before they could cause injury"". ""Schools reflect our society, and they cannot, on their own, stem the rise in verbal and physical violence that characterizes our times,"" he wrote on X. ""The real challenge lies here: fundamental work to de-escalate tensions. This involves families, teaching staff, elected officials, and every citizen. This is a fight we must wage together.""

Greece blames smugglers over migrant deaths but early accounts have been questioned before,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4g51n1jv79o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss,"Wed, 04 Feb 2026 13:22:02 GMT","Greek officials were quick to blame smugglers, but experience tells us to be wary of instant and unequivocal explanations.","The death of 15 Afghan and Moroccan migrants after a speedboat carrying them collided with a Greek coastguard vessel has been presented by Greek authorities as an open and shut case. A statement issued late on Tuesday blamed ""smugglers"" for ""failing to comply with the [Hellenic] Coast Guard's visual and audible signals"" to turn their boat around.  It said the migrant boat was making dangerous manoeuvres before veering into a patrol vessel, off the Chios Strait. The message was that this caused the deaths and the injuries of 24 others who were trying to reach European soil.  But experience tells us to be wary of such instant and unequivocal explanations. In the summer of 2023, I arrived in the southern Greek port city of Kalamata on the day more than 650 migrants were feared to have drowned. Already, an official Greek narrative had been established that this was a tragedy caused by criminal gangs cramming too many people into an unseaworthy fishing boat. We were told there was nothing that could have been done to save those onboard, including the estimated 100 women and children who were travelling in the hold of the Adriana. But survivors then told the BBC that coastguards had caused the migrant boat to capsize following a botched attempt to tow it. As we returned to Greece to investigate over the following months, more and more contradictions appeared in the official account. Nearly three years on, four senior figures in the Greek coastguard, including its current commander, are among 21 officers now facing criminal prosecution for negligent manslaughter over what was the worst loss of life in the Mediterranean Sea for a decade. It is far too early to draw confident comparisons between 2023 and this latest case, but it may be useful to point out what has happened before where the coastguard has been present when migrants have died at sea. As for Tuesday's fatal incident, near Chios, much of the Greek media has been amplifying the story that the migrant speedboat was manoeuvring dangerously and would not stop. There has so far been no testimony from the survivors to back up or question that account. There is also a lack of independent, third-party evidence that may support the scenario where the packed migrants boat had deliberately hit the specialist military speedboat. Any video of the supposed collision could be hugely significant. But it is not clear whether the coastguard was recording its interaction with the migrant boat. In the case of the Adriana disaster in 2023, the patrol ship involved had been equipped with state-of-the-art, EU-funded, cameras. They had been deactivated. Mobile phone footage - taken by their coastguards or the migrants during this latest fatal crossing - could also be pivotal. Again, we do not know what has happened to the phones owned by those involved on Tuesday night. But we do know that in the 2023 case 20 mobiles belonging to migrants went missing for 25 days. They were eventually discovered on the island of Kythira, 60 nautical miles from Kalamata, after being left in a bag on a coastguard vessel, so said officials. Following previous migrant crossings, Greek authorities have often confiscated communication equipment of those detained for making illegal crossings, while they investigate who - if anyone - had been a smuggler, not merely a paying passenger. Greece remains a key route for people from the Middle East and elsewhere wanting to reach the European Union. The UNHCR, the United Nations Refugee Agency, says 41,696 people arrived in Greece by sea in 2025. That is a fall from 54,417 in 2024. Last year 107 people were reported dead or missing attempting the crossing to the Greek mainland and islands. Since 2019, the conservative government of Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis has pursued a much tougher approach against illegal migration. This has proved to be popular among many voters and was an important issue during the last general election, in 2023, which Mitsotakis's party won. However, human rights groups have consistently accused the Greek coastguard of pursuing dangerous and illegal policies at sea. The Greek government and the coastguard deny these accusations, saying its officers act within the law and have saved hundreds of migrants' lives at sea over the past decade. But the EU border agency said last year that it was reviewing 12 cases of potential human rights violations by Greece, including some allegations that migrants seeking asylum were pushed back from Greece's frontiers.  Following the latest fatal crossing, opposition politicians have quickly condemned the Greek coastguard. Gabriel Sakellaridis, a senior figure in the left-wing Nea Aristera party, posted on social media: ""Another Coast Guard deterrence operation, with specific political instructions from the government, which in the name of the 'tough' anti-immigration policy has turned Greek waters into a cemetery."" In the Greek parliament on Wednesday, Immigration Minister Thanos Plevris said he trusted the account of the coastguards who were operating off Chios on Tuesday night. He said they should be praised, in contrast to human rights activists who complained but saved no-one. Many details about this latest incident are still unknown. History suggests we may never know what really happened this time in the darkness of the Mediterranean Sea. The judge said the Department of Homeland Security Secretary did not have facts or law on her side.

Leader of South Africa's second largest party to step down,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5yvneqg1xxo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss,"Wed, 04 Feb 2026 13:47:03 GMT",The surprise move may threaten the stability of the coalition government of which the DA is a key partner.,"South Africa's Democratic Alliance (DA) leader John Steenhuisen has said he will not seek re-election as the party's leader in April - a move that may threaten the stability of the coalition government. The DA, South Africa's second largest party, entered into a coalition with its arch rival the African National Congress in 2024 after the ANC lost its parliamentary majority. Steenhuisen took over leadership of the pro-business DA in 2019 and currently serves as agriculture minister in President Cyril Ramaphosa's government. The 49-year-old was widely expected to run again but was reportedly forced to abandon his bid because of several controversies. ""For the rest of this term of office, I will focus all of my time and energy as minister of agriculture on defeating the most devastating foot-and-mouth disease outbreak our country has ever seen,"" he told a press conference. Steenhuisen began his political career aged 22 when he was elected to the council of the the port city of Durban for the Democratic Party, the DA's predecessor. He rose up through the party's local and then regional leadership before becoming leader of the party, which traditionally has a white support base, two decades later. It was widely reported that Steenhuisen would run unopposed for the leadership at the DA's upcoming conference. But it seems a variety of issues led to his decision not to do so, including his fallout with another senior DA member, ex-Environment Affairs Minister Dion George, and allegations, of which he was cleared in January, that he had abused his party credit card. He has also been criticised for his handling of the foot-and-mouth outbreak, with farmers accusing his department of being an ""obstacle in a crisis"", according to South Africa's News24 website. The country has struggled over the past four years to contain the highly infectious virus that has now spread to most the country's provinces - badly affecting the livestock industry. It causes blisters inside an animal's mouth and under their hooves, which can cause lameness and problems feeding. In dairy cattle, milk yields will be lost and the cattle's value will be permanently reduced. Under Steenhuisen, the DA party agreed to join the ANC as its biggest partner in the government of national unity nearly two years ago. It was an historic moment for the country as the ANC, the party that  brought in democratic rule in 1994 with Nelson Mandela and ended white-minority rule, had lost its parliamentary majority. As expected it has been a fractious political marriage, but despite some differences they have stayed together - and Steenhuisen and Ramaphosa have shown how the partnership can work. This was best exemplified when they supported each other in the Oval Office showdown with US President Donald Trump in May last year. After Trump confronted the delegation with a video in support of discredited claims of a white genocide in South Africa, it was Steenhuisen who assured the US president that the majority of white farmers wanted to stay in the country. Their performance proved to South Africans that the government of national unity was worth the bickering at home. No DA leaders have announced their candidacies for the top post yet, but Cape Town mayor Geordin Hill-Lewis has been touted as a possible successor.  Steenhuisen and Hill-Lewis are close and the latter has repeatedly said he would not run against his friend, according to the TimesLive news site.
